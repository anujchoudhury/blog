### Problem:

Given an integer array `nums`, return *an array* `answer` *such that* `answer[i]` *is equal to the product of all the elements of* `nums` *except* `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`
- The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

**Follow up:** Can you solve the problem in `O(1)`extra space complexity? (The output array **does not** count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

### Solution:
The problem is kind of simple, if you've seen it before - or experienced it. Similar to delayed multiplication, we first compute the prefix product, and store it in the output array, and then compute the suffix array and follow the same process. Here goes:

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> outputarr(nums.size(),1);// contains the output array(final)
        int curr=1;
        for(int i=1;i<nums.size();i++){
            curr=curr*nums[i-1];
            outputarr[i]*=curr;
        }
        curr=1;
        for(int i=nums.size()-2;i>=0;i--){
            curr=curr*nums[i+1];
            outputarr[i]*=curr;
        }
        return outputarr;
    }
};
```
